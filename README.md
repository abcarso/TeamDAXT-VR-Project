# DAXT VR Project
DAXT VR group project

This semester long group project was made in Unity for a VR class at Clemson University.
The theme for the project was "For Social Good", each group chose their own topic and demostrated a need that VR could fill.

We chose to demonstrate that VR could be used to help teach a language.
We believe that VR is suited to the task by:
- Utilizing spacial memory to better remember vocabulary
- Making vocabulary more intutive by interacting with the objects described
- Making use of virtual humans to reliably practice concepts
